# DogeWorld

An abandoned server plugin. Monolithic, not cached (Was on the To-Do list). Use whatever you want, even make money off of it. I couldn't care less. Just change the name, as required by the license. Really, you can use this code and make your own server! Monetize it! Get rich! Make Dogecoin explode yourself! I hope you do. At least there's a running server then. 

## I have one request, though.

Don't ask me about help. I will silently ignore you. Read a book about Java programming if you need Java help. Read the JavaDocs or watch a YouTube tutorial if you don't know how to code. But don't come to me. I mean it.
